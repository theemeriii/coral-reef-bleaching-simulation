# Coral Reef Bleaching Simulation: A Spatial Cellular Automata Model

A spatial environmental simulation modeling coral bleaching dynamics under climate stress, acidification, and pollution using a stochastic cellular automata framework.

## Overview

This project implements a spatial cellular automata simulation to model coral reef ecosystem dynamics under environmental stressors including temperature anomalies, ocean acidification, and agricultural runoff pollution. The model evaluates environmental management strategies through stochastic Monte Carlo experiments.

## System Model and Dynamics

The reef is modeled as a 2D grid tracking coral density, bleaching state, pollution levels, and stress exposure. Environmental stress combines global heat events, gradual acidification, and spatially transported pollution inflow.

## Results: Coral Abundance Under Different Scenarios

![Coral Abundance Results](assets/coral_abundance_results.png)

Baseline and runoff-reduction scenarios lead to long-term coral decline, while local resilience interventions delay mortality and preserve higher coral density.

## Bleaching and Mortality Dynamics

Bleaching spreads rapidly under sustained stress conditions, increasing mortality incidence over time. Local resilience interventions reduce bleaching severity and delay collapse.

## Spatial Outcome Distributions
